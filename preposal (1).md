# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
We planned to create a Python language software engineering game called "The Crossy Road."

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I planned to collaborate with Rahul and David.

## Do you have any questions of your own?
When planning to create the game, a question arises: Which tools or libraries should we use to make the cross-road game, and why?  # Me and our group finally figured out the best tools for creating the name. We planned to use PyGame tool.
