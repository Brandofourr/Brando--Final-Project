# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
After discussing with the group, me and my group members planned to name this game a "Chicken Crossing the Road" for the final project.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
The game where chicken crosses the road.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
Our project is based on the video game "The Crossy Road." The game we planned to create for the final project is described as a Python language game where the players help the chicken cross the road, and there are obstacles like cars moving up and down the chicken. The goal is to reach the other side without getting hit to win the game. The game gets more challenging as obstacles move faster or appear more often. We used simple graphics and controls created with tools like Pygame. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
If we have to chose the different class that is similar for the final project, that would be CIS 1057 because C language is fast and works well with game libraries, which help create graphics and handle game features. This makes it a good choice for building games like Crossy Road and tools like Pygame, which simplifies game-making in Python.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
Groupmate Name: David Zhu
TA: Elmira Talebianaraki, Section 001
Email: tut13427@temple.edu

Another Groupmate name: Rahul Basnet
TA: Elmira Talebianaraki, Section 001
Email: tut53805@temple.edu


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A good outcome from our project is knowing how to properly use "if" and "else" statements.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The better outcome for our final project is knowing how to get and use different type of files in the program.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome from our project is making the best version of the Crossy Road Video Game.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
Our group needed to acquire multiple skills to make the best project. First, we researched online on adequately using a specific file to make the character the user will control during the game. This topic will also teach us how to create different vehicle shapes as obstacle courses for the player. Next, we need to learn what other modules are being used and their functions in the Python language. I worked with two different people for this final project. I researched the coding process of this program. Rahul searched all the materials and gathered all the essential files and images for this final project. David fixed the different errors that came up while coding. This makes our final program show the best version of the Video Game.
